# REST API

What is REST?

REST stands for Representational State Transfer.

It means when a RESTful API is called, the server will transfer to the client a representation of the state of the requested resource.

The operation you want the server to perform on that resource, in the form of an HTTP method, or verb. The common HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
